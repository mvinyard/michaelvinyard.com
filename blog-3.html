									<h2>2019 SF Marathon Prep Week 5 (Post #2</h2>
									<span><a href="#">Published May 23rd, 2019</a><a href="#"> - Michael Vinyard</a></span>

									<p>I've been slacking on both my running as well as keeping up with my blog <i>about</i> running!</p>
									<p>Life has been busy the last few weeks. One thing I have learned is that while you can make a really great plan, sticking to it is another story and there is a skill in being able to keep with something despite your plan not working out quite the way you had hoped. What I am really getting at is that I there have been days where 9 or 10 PM rolled around and I had been procrastinating running all day. Several times in that moment, I resigned myself to being better the next day and relaxing for the evening of focusing on something school-related. However, what I have come to realize that is that, perhaps counterintuitively, there is actually somewhat of an energy barrier to skipping a run and it lowers the more you skiip. It's easier to skip a run on Wednesday, if you already decided that it was ok to skip a run on Tuesday, despite telling yourself that you would recommit on said Wednesday! It's all about momentum!</p>

									<p><strong>Strava gave me a nice summary graphic for my April stats:</strong>

									</a></div></p>

									<p>While I have encountered my fair share of failures to launch out of my computer chair and onto the pavement in the past week or two, I have exceeded my own expectations in a few ways, especially as it pertains to the long run. On Saturday of Week 2, the long-run day, I was slated to run about 7 miles. I made my way down to the Charles for what turned out to be a really nice twilight-time run. There was a beautiful sunset and I was feeling great. About 4 miles in, I decided I wasn't ready to turn around and getting a little adventurous, I thought that maybe I could hit 10 miles today instead of 7. At 5 miles, I still wasn't ready to turn around. Knowing that for each mile further that I ran, that added another mile, which I would have to run back - or even worse, walk if I were to hit a wall. I turned around at 6.5 miles. At this point, I was starting to feel it in my hips. Still, I ended up rounding out that run at 12 miles! 5 miles greater than I had planned, for the day! This was a huge confidence boost for me.</p>

									<p>I sort of ran with this conidence boost into the following week and I was able to do two half marathon-length long runs on the Saturdays of week 3 and 4. Week 5 (last Saturday), I was hoping to continue the streak but I encountered an unexpectedly hot afternoon that I was absolutely not prepared for and I caved at just about a <i>quarter</i> of a marathon. I'll call it a recovery week. I got back on track (or a bit ahead of track) with another half marathon today! While it hurt quite a bit, it was warm and I was pretty fatigued, overall. That's 3 half marathons in 4 weeks, I think that's pretty good progress.</p>

									<p>In other running news, I ran the <a href = 'https://runsignup.com/Race/MA/Boston/Harpoon5Miler'>Harpoon 5-Miler</a> on Sunday. This was a great time - Harpoon is one of my favorite breweries. In addition, they raised money to fund reasearch for a disease that is close to my heart, ALS.</p>

									<p>Thursday I decided to venture out with a new pair of shoes. I typically go to <a href = "https://www.marathonsports.com/locations/cambridge/">Marathon Sports in Cambridge</a> because their staff is always so nice and so helpful. While I have been running in Brooks Adrenaline 18s/19s for the past year or so, I decided to go with the <a href = "https://www.hokaoneone.com/mens-road/gaviota-2/192410077694.html?source=ggl_ppc_nb_dsa&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIxNqXrIm44gIVLrazCh07sg25EAAYASAAEgIY0fD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds">HOKA ONEONE GAVIOTA 2s</a>. I have been hearing a ton of hype surrounding HOKAs and some of my favorite runners that I like to follow on Strava and/or Instagram wear them, professionally. From what I understand, their unique offering is that they have a somewhat curved sole - at the risk of embarrasing myself, think Sketcher's ShapeUps... but a bit more stylish. They were super comfortable when I tested them out so I decided to put in an order. I am hoping to use them for my long run on Saturday! Who knows, maybe I'll get back up to that half-marathon distance. Per my original plan, I was only slated to run 12 miles that weekend, but going off-script (while feeling good) has given me a bit of confidence.</p>

										 <p>In keeping with a schedule for marathon training, there is a lot more than just a single long run each week. Each of the daily runs throughout the week, while a bit shorter are super important. It's much easier, I've found to run nearly every day and cap off the week with a solid long run, than to run just 3 or 4 times per week with one of those being a super long-distance run. I never feel quite ready for it. I'm actually not really bummed at all about 'failing' my long run last Saturday. It was hot and humid and I didn't feel well. While I would like to think that I would need to be ready to handle that on a potential marathon race day, those days are going to happen. This is where I think it would be really great to spend more time looking for a team or someone to run with on a regular basis to help me push through these really tough days.</p>

										 <p>Moving forward, I am going to try and focus on not missing a single run, be it short or long between now and the day of the Marathon. That will be easier said than done with the hot weather coming... sometimes once you get into the middle of a hot day, it's really easy to just put your run off with heat-inspired excuses to stay in the air conditioning. In addition, I need to commit more time each day to stretch and roll after runs. I also really need to incorporate strength-training, even if it's just body-weight stuff. I think I could really improve with a bit of hip-flexor strength.Hopefully I'll have more on that front in my next post!</p>
