									<h2>CRISPR-suppressor scanning reveals a nonenzymatic role of LSD1 in AML</h2>

									<p>The first paper from my PhD work is out now in <i>Nature Chemical Biology!</i> We investigate the mechanism of LSD1 and inhibitors of LSD1 in the context of acute myeloid leukemia. We were also able to perform the first structure-activity relationship study in the context of CRISPR-suppressor screen. This was a large and coordinated effort with great friends and colleagues, thanks to all involved.</p>

									<p><strong>Brief Overview of motivation, approach, and results:</strong></p>
									<p>I anticipate that the format of this blog will essentially reflect a dynamic picture of my ongoing life - currently, that picture is defined by two main axes: academic inquiry and running - graduate school only allows for so much deviation from a main focus or two! However, I think I am somewhat of a good fit for such a lifestyle; I truly enjoy thinking hard about a small collection of inter-related problems. I'll try to keep tags on each of my posts and put together more organized collections - this page will be a chronological posting of each, with perhaps one or two articles pinned to the top.</p>

									<p>During my first two years in the Liau Lab, I was lucky enough to start working on a project, which combined several areas of biolgy and chemistry that I found exciting. With my collaborators, I performed a CRISPR-supressor screen of LSD1(lysine-specific demethylase one). Inhibitors of LSD1 are currently in clinical trials, the leaders of this group are mechanism-based, suicide inhibitors of LSD1 - they use the enzyme's own demethylase activity to covalently label the cofacor and irreversibly destroy all demethylase ability of LSD1. While these inhibitors are potent and effective in acute myeloid leukemia as well as small cell lung cancer, the downstream mechanism of how they block cancer was poorly understood. We were interested in learning about the biological consequences of inhibiting LSD1 in cancer as well as pushing the limitations of the newly-developed CRISPR-scanning ultilty. To my knowledge, we were the first to actually perform a full tiling screen (using all sgRNAs along the full coding sequence) of a protein. That said, we were unsure of the resolution with which we might be able to pick apart mechanisms using such screens.</p>

									<p>As it turned out, we were able to pick apart the domains of LSD1 <a href = 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-019-0263-0/figures/2'>quite well</a> this computational effort, inspired by CLUMPs, another method for investigating 3D protein domains, was really driven by Brian as well as my great friend and colleague, <a href = "http://www.liaulab.org/allison-siegenfeld">Allison Seigenfeld.</a></p>

									<p>The suicide inhibitors of LSD1 are primarily based off of the MOA inhibitors of old (tranylcypromine or TCP) used to treat depression. We went on to investigate further, the catalytic pocket of LSD1 and its interaction with such TCP-based inhibitors. To do this, <a href = "http://www.liaulab.org/amanda-waterbury">Amanda Waterbury</a> synthesized various analogues of these inhibitors, leaving the pharmacophore and binding motif intact while modifying the hydrocarbon appendage on the tail end of the drug. We funneled several of these inhibitor varients into our CRISPR-supressor format - this process scales OK - <a href = "http://www.liaulab.org/ally-freedy">Ally Freedy</a> and I were able to run this screen with about ten molecules and we probably could have handled more the second time around with proper planning and know-how from the first experience - although I am not sure that the current format is ammenable to a large-scale, parallel investigation. Maybe if you're a drug company with 20 people to throw at this problem, you could really learn a lot about drug-target interactions this way - that would really be spectacular in my opinion. In any case, this is the first example of a group gleaning structure-activity relationship data from a CRISPR screen in the presence of an inhibitor.</p>

									<p>From our CRISPR experiments, we were able to pull out mutants of LSD1 that were resistant to the drug - we validated this in singlicate as well. We genotyped these resistant mutants to find that they harbored mutations in the catalytic domain. Further, we tested these mutants <i>in vitro</i> to find that they are <strong>enzyme-dead!</strong> If we take a step back, we realize this makes no sense. These inhibitors were developed during an era where the prevailing notion is that we can program and reprogram the 'epignomic code.' If you've read Steve Henikoff and Ali Shilatifard's perspective in <i><a href = "https://www.cell.com/trends/genetics/fulltext/S0168-9525(11)00097-7">Trends in Genetics</a></i>, you  might agree that this is now pass√©. Anyways, the thoguht was that LSD1's enzyme activity is dysregulated in cancers like AML and by blocking this enzyme activity, we can halt the proliferative activity in its tracks... and that worked, so why not believe it? Until you have a <strong>drug-resistant mutant of LSD1, which is enzyme dead... which supposedly rescues from an inhibitor of LSD1 enzyme activity.</strong> This can get confusing if you're not paying attention. This clued us into the fact that there must be more to the story when it comes to LSD1 function in cancer!</p>

									<p>We also performed ChIP-seq and whole-transcriptome RNA-seq on treated vs. non-treated cells, both wild type and the catalytically-dead, drug-resistant and mutants from above. The coolest part about the RNA-seq analysis, in my opinion is that Allison and Brian were able to tease apart, using the clone (which, importantly is <strong>enzyme-dead</strong>) and cluster gene-expression differences to highlight genes that are directly linked to the presecne or absence of the demethylase activity. You can do this by comparing the untreated wild type cells to the untreated mutant cells. However, one could argue that these gene expression differnces could be the result of the CRISPR transduction and perhaps other shock-related factors - either way, there is probably some real biology in there somewhere and it would be a cool thing to follow up on.</p>

									<p><a href = "http://www.liaulab.org/cindy-su">Cindy</a>, <a href = "http://www.liaulab.org/pallavi-gosavi">Pallavi</a>, and Amanda performed a slew of cell-based and in vitro assays to validate the finding that the LSD1 enzyme activity is dispensible in AML. They were also able to, through chemical genetics assay in vitro and in cells, pin down definitively, the putative binding partner of LSD1 - GFI1/1B. This interaction is the actual lynch-pin, which is being removed upon drug binding. As a final link to the overall mechanism, we were able to tie the LDS1/GFI1 interaction to a PU.1 activity assay in 293Ts - this ties together two seperate findings from 2018 - 1) that LSD1 and GFI1/1B maintain a potentially critical interaction in AML <a href = "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29590629">(Maiques-Diaz, 2018)</a>, which is disrupted upon TCP-based drug binding and 2) that partial knockdown of PU.1 or CEBPa rescue from LSD1-inhibition in AML <a href = "http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/early/2018/02/16/blood-2017-09-807024?sso-checked=true">(Cusan, 2018)</a>.</p>

									<p>This was such an exciting story to be apart of and I am really grateful for the entire experience, especially everything that I learned from Brian as well as my co-authors. I really found my passion for mechanistic biology in working on this project and this has only solidified my philosophy that I will find happiness in understanding events on a molecular level.</p>  <h4>Updated: April 18, 2019</h4>
