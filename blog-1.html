									<h2>Running Blog - 2019 SF Marathon Prep Week # 1</h2>
									<span><a href="#">Published April 17, 2019</a><a href="#"> - Michael Vinyard</a></span>
									<p>I am currently training for the 2019 San Francisco Marathon. I completed my first marathon in September of 2018, the <a href = "http://mainemarathon.com">Maine Marathon</a> in Portland, ME. I signed up for this marathon on the day of the Boston Marathon in 2018 - I was on the treadmill at the gym, watching the coverage of the marathon and I was just feeling inspired. At first, I just considered this a bucket list item for me - I knew I had to train and that I had to take it seriously to be able to complete the marathon without injury, but I did not expect to get so sucked into the culture. However, I can't say I blame myself - the people who do these races (and longer) are awesome and inspiring.</p>

									<p>It started with podcasts about running - when I started I was overall disatisfied with my physical fitness; this was actually a major reason for me wanting to do a marathon in the first place. I wanted to get in shape and I needed something to hold me accountable. So, being frustrated with my fitness and slow running speed, I turned to podcasts to learn more. I also found them quite inspiring. This was my first step into the culture of distance running. I then started to get in touch with local running clubs - one of my favorites that I still try to make it to is <a href = "https://www.facebook.com/bostonroadrunners/">Boston Road Runners</a>. There are a ton of novice and experienced runners of all speeds that are graet to learn from and talk to during a Saturday morning on the Charles River.</p>

									<p>As my training for SF 2019 ramps up, I will post more about my plan and keep this blog updated with how things are going! I have linked my Strava account at the bottom of the page and I'll try to push my HTML and CSS abilities to link the media from Strava in cool ways.</p>

									<p><strong>Week 1:</strong> I got off to a late start for this training cycle. I had a lot going on with school and life and this prevented me from maintaining the ~40 mi/week schedule I had been following back in January - not to mention the weather in Boston can be relatively disruptive to a good outdoor training schedule if you're not careful.</p>

									<p>I got back into the swing of things on Tuesday evening. I typically don't like running at night, but it's what my schedule has allowed lately, so I am suffering through it. I did make it all the way through until Sunday - I am unsure if I want to go for a run-streak or take a schedule day off... I suppose I could always squeeze in a quick mile if I wanted to count that as my ~minimum~ to keep a run streak alive.</p>
									<p><strong>The long run.</strong> I did a psuedo-long run this week. I wouldn't really call this a long run; it was only 6 miles and the rest of my weekly mileage (31 miles in total) was made up of daily 5 mile runs, BUT it's a matter of laying the groundwork for the future weekend long runs to come. One thing I definitely let slip (and regretted it) in training for the marathon I did last year was not sticking to a regimented long run schedule. I was too lenient with myself and I paid the price for it come race day. I actually planned out the remainder of my long runs this weekened and they are as follows:</p>
									<ul>
											 <li>April 20: 6 mi <strong>(DONE)</strong></li>
											 <li>April 27: 7 mi</li>
											 <li>May 4: 8 mi</li>
											 <li>May 11: 10 mi</li>
											 <li>May 18: 11</li>
											 <li>May 25: 12</li>
											 <li>June 1: 14 mi</li>
											 <li>June 8: 15 mi</li>
											 <li>June 15: 16 mi</li>
											 <li>June 22: 18 mi</li>
											 <li>June 29: 20 mi</li>
											 <li>July 6: 22 mi <i>Cue the beginning of taper!</i></li>
											 <li>July 13: 12 mi</li>
											 <li>July 20: 10 mi</li>
											 <li>July 28: Race Day - 26.2 mi</li>
									</ul>

									<p>In looking at this schedule, the one thing that comes to mind is that it is a LOT of long runs. I think I am much more prepared this time around, however to handle such a schedule. I think I got above 30 miles per week (mpw) maybe two or three times before my first marathon due to a tough schedule. This time, I am starting out at greater than 30 mpw. The week of the 22 miler, I hope to be up around 70 mpw, but we'll see how it goes. I recently heard a quote, paraphrased from Meb Keflezighi that it's better to be undertrained and healthy than overtrained and injured. With that many long runs scheduled, I would feel pretty comfortable accomodating one or two to stay in tip-top shape. I have struggled with plantar fasciitis for a while, so managing that is always a chore.</p>

									<p>To keep this post from getting too lengthy, I think I'll stop here and leave myself and you all with this satisfying Strava screenshot: <img src="images/strava-1.jpeg" width="337.5" height="222"></p>
